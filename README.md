### Running the script

- Clone this repository
- Run `Rscript <path to>/run_analysis.R` (You might have connection to the Internet to run this script as it will try to fetch the dataset if it hasn't been dowloaded yet)
- The tidy dataset should get created in the current directory as `output.txt`
- Code book for the tidy dataset is available [here](CodeBook.md)
